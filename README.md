# vape-finder-scraper

## Description

Content discovery for the [BC Vape Finder](https://github.com/MiguellDomingues/vape-finder-client/) project

## Purpose

I developed this project to explore from end-to-end a practical application of web scraping and the ETL process. Tasks include:

- Implementing scripts of varying complexity to crawl, scrape, clean and categorize product data from 3 different e-commerce websites into JSON files with a common structure
- Validating products against a schema and inserting them into a mongodb collection
